# 🎬 Will It Travel?

*Will your Indian content travel into other languages? — a Travel Score (0–100),
per language, with the localization gap shown honestly.*

Predicts how well Indian video/audio content will **localise into other Indian
languages** — with honest, explainable scoring instead of a naïve code-mixing
percentage.

Paste a YouTube URL or upload an MP3/MP4/WAV. The app transcribes it with the
**Sarvam STT API**, runs five scoring engines, and returns a per-language **Dub
Worthiness Score (0–100)**, a risk breakdown, a transcript explorer,
language-priority recommendations, a **playable sample dub** (translated + voiced
with Sarvam TTS) so you can *hear* what the score means, and a **Localization Gap**
view that shows — live — where free machine translation *transliterates* English
terms vs what a natural dub should say.

**Works in any direction across English, Hindi, and Tamil** — it auto-detects the
source language and scores dubbing into the other two (English→Tamil,
Tamil→Hindi, Hindi→English, etc.).

> The core idea: code-mixing *percentage* is a useless signal. "Kal meeting hai"
> is 100% mixed yet trivially dubbable. What actually predicts dubbing pain is
> *meaning loss*, *idiomatic density*, *cultural distance*, *structural
> interleaving*, and *prosody dependence*. This tool measures those instead.

## How it scores

**Travel Score (0–100)** — starts at 100, subtracts five weighted penalties:

| Engine | Weight | Measures |
|---|---|---|
| Semantic loss (back-translation) | 35% | Meaning lost on a translate→back-translate round-trip — the most honest signal. |
| Idiomatic density | 25% | Slang/idioms where surface meaning ≠ real meaning (574-entry dictionary). |
| Cultural reference risk | 20% | References an audience may not recognise (646-entry base, per-audience familiarity for English/Hindi/Tamil). |
| Structural interleaving | 10% | Languages fused mid-sentence — no clean seam to re-voice along. |
| Prosody dependency | 10% | Meaning carried by delivery, not words (text-based proxy). |

**Audience Opportunity** is scored **separately** and is *never multiplied* into
quality — a hard-to-dub video can still be worth localising if the audience
upside is large. The dashboard shows both side by side.

## Quickstart (local)

```bash
# 1. Create an isolated environment (Python 3.11 recommended)
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Install ffmpeg (system dependency)
#    macOS:  brew install ffmpeg
#    Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install ffmpeg

# 3. Add your Sarvam API key (NEVER commit this file — it's git-ignored)
#    Edit .streamlit/secrets.toml:
#       SARVAM_API_KEY = "your_real_key_here"
#    Get a free key at https://dashboard.sarvam.ai

# 4. Run
streamlit run app.py
```

### Handling your API key securely
- **Local:** put it only in `.streamlit/secrets.toml` (git-ignored, lock it with
  `chmod 600 .streamlit/secrets.toml`). Or export `SARVAM_API_KEY` as an env var.
- **Deployment:** put it only in Streamlit Cloud → **Settings → Secrets**.
- Never hard-code it, never commit it. `.gitignore` already excludes the secrets
  file and `.env`.

### Notable engineering decisions
- **Chunked STT:** Sarvam's sync endpoint caps at ~30 s, so audio is split into
  <30 s windows, transcribed, and stitched — the naïve single-call approach fails
  on anything longer than a short clip.
- **`saarika:v2.5`, deliberately:** it transcribes faithfully, preserving
  code-switching. `saaras:v3` can normalise/translate the mix, which would erase
  the exact signal the structural and semantic engines measure.
- **CPU-only PyTorch pinned** (`--extra-index-url …/cpu`) to fit Streamlit Cloud's
  ~1 GB tier; the embedding model loads via `@st.cache_resource`.
- **Scope is stated honestly:** the score rates whether content is *worth* dubbing
  (meaning/structure preservability of the source), **not** the fluency of a
  specific machine dub. Back-translation uses the same engine both ways, so a
  transliteration ("cuticle"→"க்யூட்டிகில்") round-trips perfectly and reads as
  "clean" — the score can't catch a bad auto-dub. I tested three fluency detectors
  (romanised-leakage, source jargon-density, target-language OOV-rate); none was
  reliable, so the limitation is flagged in the UI rather than faked with a number.
- **Other limitations are surfaced, not hidden:** prosody is a text proxy;
  `langdetect` is weak on short/Romanised text; dictionary matching favours
  Roman/code-mixed tokens. Each is labelled in the UI.
